This task was a practise with making Ruby on Rails web applications when I first started learning web development. The web application demonstrates simple Ruby on Rails and CRUD functionality.

## Getting Started
Run the following commands in your terminal to get the web application working:
* Clone this repository into your terminal.
* rake:db create
* rake:db migrate
* rake:db seed
* rake:db reset (to reset the database)
* rails s

## Prerequisites
All you will need to access this web application is to clone this repository, run a series of rakes in the terminal and run the server, which will then run the web application in your web browser.

### Gems
Run the following commands in your terminal to get the required gem dependencies:
* gem install sinatra
* gem install rack

The following gems are included in the program's syntax:
* gem "sinatra"
* gem "sinatra-reloader" if development?
* gem "rack"

## Built With
This web application was built in Sublime Text with the following languages and web technologies:

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
